						<blockquote><p>Professional who has more than 10+ years of combined hands-on experience in test engineering with an educational background in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science and project management. Strong skills in designing, reviewing, implementing, upgrading, analyzing, and solving complex problems with creativity and out-of-the-box solutions. Extensive knowledge of applications, integration, hardware, and quality testing. Solid understanding of basic RF technologies, the use of electronic measurement instruments, manufacturing test development strategies & methodologies.</p>  

						<p>Â I am a self-motivated person and love being a creative person who thinks outside the box. but have learned to be practical in finding the most effective solution.  I like working with people of different cultures and backgrounds the more different the background the more interesting I find them. Because they give me a different perspective I didn't see before or blind to. I enjoy working and doing test development working with new and old products. There so may disciplines that you must utilize to achieve end results.  Even in my personal projects I'm plying mathematics and physics and computer science in most of my projects. Whether it's printing a 3D drone and selecting components for complete assembly. I am working with my raspberry pie computer to control my 3D printer. building a wishing well with solar panels to run the flowing water. Drawing out the angles of the rafters creating hexagon roof style having people asking where'd you get the kit I said no kit custom. </p>

						<p>My whole career has been as a test engineer It is not only my career it's my passion. I enjoy the work and I enjoy contributing to a company success and knowing that I had a part in that success. I'm not only curious in my own projects as a test developer but I'm also very interested in what my colleagues are doing. How they approach given problems and solutions. Give them positive feedback, support and encouragement. I know I have the skill sets to contribute to this company in a very positive manner which is important to me also. A company that has a good work culture and can be a great place to work that will utilize my skill sets and strengths which in the end will help others in the world live better lives.</p>
